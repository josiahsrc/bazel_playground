# Notes

You have to run gazelle without update repos for it to work with generating build files `bazel run //:gazelle`.

You have to run gazelle with the repos option to update the dependencies automagically `bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod`.

The golang server is slow sometimes it looks like. Give it a second to quit throwing a tantrum and it will probably correct its deps.

Domain driven development is what golang suggests (but not needed, you can structure your project however).

`go get google.golang.org/protobuf/proto` is the way to import protobufs...

Autogenerated build files > not autogenerated build files :) BUT, it's okay if some folders aren't autogenerated. You can fix them yourself. Gazelle will help as much as it can.

DELETE GENERATED BUILD FILES IF YOU CHANGE THE DIR NAME, gazelle won't fix these it looks like

Helpful example for protos in java and go: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/examples/addressbook.proto
